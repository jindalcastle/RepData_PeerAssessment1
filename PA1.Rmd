# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
data = read.csv("~/activity.csv",header = TRUE)
attach(data)

```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)$steps
hist(steps_per_day)
```

Mean:
```{r}
mean(steps_per_day)
```

Median:
```{r}
median(steps_per_day)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
plot(steps_by_interval$steps, type="l")

```
Row of interval with highest mean steps

```{r}
max_interval = which.max(steps_by_interval$steps)
max_interval
```

Original "interval" value of this row:
```{r}
interval[max_interval]
```


## Imputing missing values

Number of missing rows in total
```{r}
sum(is.na(steps))
```


Unsophisticated strategy: Fill in zeros for every na value.
```{r}
steps[is.na(steps)] <- 0
```

Create new dataframe with imputed steps
```{r}
imputed <- data.frame(date=date,  steps=steps, interval=interval)
attach(imputed)
imputed_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, imputed, sum)
hist(imputed_per_day$steps)
```


New mean
```{r}
mean(imputed_per_day$steps)
```

New median
```{r}
median(imputed_per_day$steps)
```

My imputation strategy shifts the distribution markedly towards lower values.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
  "Friday", "Saturday")[as.POSIXlt(date)$wday + 1]
```
Now aggregate by weekendedness:
```{r}
weekend <- weekdays == "Sunday" | weekdays == "Saturday"
imputed$weekend = weekend
weekday_activities <- aggregate(steps ~ weekend + interval, imputed, mean)
```

Activity on weekends:
```{r}
plot(weekday_activities[weekday_activities$weekend==T,]$steps, t='l')
```

Activity on weekdays:
```{r}
plot(weekday_activities[weekday_activities$weekend==F,]$steps, t='l')
```
